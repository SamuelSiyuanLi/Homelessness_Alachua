# Homelessness Investigation in Alachua County, Gainesville
This repository includes the R script file, the presentation, and the raw data for the project,
This project is dedicated to investing in the homelessness trends in Alachua County based on three aspects: racial proportions, sheltered conditions of veterans, and the youth below 18.
For the data cleaning process, I extracted and transformed a few variables from the original dataset("2011-2023-PIT-Veteran-Counts-by-CoC.xlsx").
Meanwhile, I searched for additional data from the Gainesville Census data (https://datausa.io/profile/geo/alachua-county-fl) to improve the accuracy of the analysis.
The project uses pie charts, a histogram, and a line graph to observe the changes in homelessness rates between 2013 - 2023.
Since the data are missing for some years, the analysis might only focus on the existing records within the effective year ranges.
